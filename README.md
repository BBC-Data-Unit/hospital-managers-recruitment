## Methodology notes

The figures for Dec 2013, 2014 and 2015 are bespoke figures given to us by NHS Digital. The methodology that NHS Digital used for 2016 and 2017 is different to the previous years so they recalculated the 2013 â€“ 2015 figures to make them directly comparable to the 2016 and 2017 figures.

Our analysis looks at all NHS Trusts except ambulance trusts. There are 10 of these trusts in England. 

Also as there has been a reorganisation of the NHS in recent years there are now fewer NHS Trusts in existence compared to 2013.
As a result the following trusts have no comparable data as they have either been disbanded, merged, or were not in existence in December 2013.

*	Torbay and Southern Devon Health and Care NHS Trust
*	London North West Healthcare NHS Trust
*	Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust
*	Royal National Hospital For Rheumatic Diseases NHS Foundation Trust
*	Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
*	West Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust
*	Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust
*	Calderstones Partnership NHS Foundation Trust
